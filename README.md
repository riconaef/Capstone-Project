## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, demographic data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany is analyzed, comparing it against demographics information of the general population. Unsupervised and Supervised learning techniques are used to perform customer segmentation, to find out the core customer base of the company. The data which is used here has been provided by the company Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The analysis is separated into two jupyter notebook files:

- Part1: Unsupervised learning.ipynb

  The first file involves the Investigation/Cleaning of the data and the Unsupervised Learning steps.

- Part2: Supervised learning.ipynb

  The second file describes the Supervised Learning procedure and prepares the file for the kaggle competition.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the analyzis were that customers of the company tend to be good earners and live in areas with small housholds.
